+ Project summary: 
We worked on building a content filtering method for the recommendation system, using Stochatic Gradient Descent algorithm. Tempoeral regularization was usd for regularization and for postprocessing, SVD with KNN and SVD with kernel ridge regression was used.
Our group’s goal is to see the difference between the two models:
	- SGD algorithm with temporal regularization and postprocessing SVD with KNN
	- SGD algorithm with temporal regularization and postprocessing SVD with kernel ridge regression

	

**Contribution statement**: 
+ Chongyu He 
+ Daniel Lee: Converted starter code from R to Python, implemented static temperal dynamics algorithm, organized github
+ Yiwen Ma: Designed and implemented entire architecture,including matrix factorization(SGD),regularization(Temperal dynamics),postprocessing(KNN and Ridge). Trained and tested the model, parameter tuning.

+ Runzi Qiang
+ Yifan Yang: Implemented the starter code of stochastic gradient descent, regularization and matrix factorization.
